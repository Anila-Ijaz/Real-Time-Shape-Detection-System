# Real-Time-Shape and Object Detection-System (YOLOv8 + OpenCV)
Real-Time Object &amp; Shape Detection (YOLOv8 + OpenCV) ‚Äì Developed a computer vision system that integrates deep learning (YOLOv8) with classical contour analysis to detect and classify objects and their geometric shapes in real time from a webcam feed.

**Language**: Python  
**Topics:** Computer Vision, Real-Time Object Detection, OpenCV, YOLOv8

This mini project uses **YOLOv8** (Ultralytics) for real-time object detection from a webcam and then runs a simple **shape detection** (triangle / rectangle / circle) on each detected object using OpenCV contours. The result is displayed live with bounding boxes and labels.

## Features
- üé• Live webcam inference with YOLOv8 (`yolov8n.pt`)
- üî≤ Bounding boxes with class labels & confidence
- üî∫ Simple shape detection on the cropped object (triangle/rectangle/circle)
- ‚å®Ô∏è Press **Q** to quit

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+ (3.10/3.11 recommended)
- Packages:
  - `ultralytics` (pulls in `torch`)
  - `opencv-python`
  - `numpy`
  - `pillow` (PIL)

If you have a CUDA-capable GPU and the right PyTorch build installed, Ultralytics/YOLO will automatically use it. Otherwise it runs on CPU.
